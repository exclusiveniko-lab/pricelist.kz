export const robotoNormal = `AAEAAAARAQAABAAQRFNJRwAAAAAAA... (truncated for brevity) ...AAAAAA==`;
// The actual file would contain a very long Base64 string.
// For the purpose of this simulation, we'll use a placeholder.
// A real implementation would have the full string here.
// You can generate this string from a .ttf file using an online converter.
